/**
 * Runs once on API startup, after MongoDB is connected and after
 * runtime/engine.js has been required (so its QueueEvents listeners
 * are already active before recovery potentially re-queues anything).
 *
 * The core problem this solves: QueueEvents is a live pub/sub-style
 * listener. If the API process was down when a node's job finished,
 * that completion notification was emitted with nobody subscribed to
 * receive it -- confirmed directly (a fresh process with no
 * QueueEvents listener attached at the time a job completed still
 * needs a way to find out what happened). This module is that way:
 * instead of *listening* for what happened, it *asks* Redis directly,
 * once, for every execution that was left RUNNING.
 *
 * It is safe to call on every single startup, not just after a crash --
 * a normal clean restart just finds nothing needs recovering and exits
 * quickly. That matters because you can't generally tell in advance
 * whether a given restart follows a crash or a deploy; the recovery
 * logic has to be correct either way, not just after a "real" crash.
